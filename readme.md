# Household Power Consumption Prediction
## Introduction
This is a project that uses neural networks to predict household power consumption. 
## Dataset Information
Georges Hebrail and Alice Berard. 2012. Individual household electric power consumption. UCI Machine Learning Repository. [https://doi.org/10.24432/C58K54](https://doi.org/10.24432/C58K54)

## Structure
This project is contained in a Jupyter notebook. By default, it would use the saved training data. If you would like to duplicate the work, in all of the models, replace the line `reload=100`, with `reload=0`. The publicly available weather dataset that was used is a part of the repository, the power consumption data must be downloaded separately.
